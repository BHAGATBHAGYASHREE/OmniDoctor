🧰 Tech Stack
Frontend: ReactJS

Build Tool: Vite

Routing: React Router DOM

State Management: React Hooks & Context API

Styling: CSS

Data: db.json for dummy data

Persistence: localStorage

🔗 Why No API Was Used?
No APIs were available during development, so we used db.json as a mock backend and stored user data and appointments in localStorage, providing persistence even after refreshing the page.

🎨 Design Decisions
Fonts: Clean and modern fonts for readability.

Colors: Blue (trust), Green (health), White backgrounds for clarity.

Layout: Responsive and mobile-friendly using Flex/Grid.

Components: Modular and reusable UI components.

🚀 Future Scope
Backend integration (Firebase, Node.js)

Authentication (JWT/OAuth)

Secure database (MongoDB/PostgreSQL)

WebRTC video call integration

Appointment reminders and notifications

✅ Summary
OmniDoctor provides a complete prototype experience of a telemedicine platform using ReactJS. It simulates a real-world workflow with local data handling and presents a foundation ready for API and backend integration.
